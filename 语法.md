##  第一章 换一种方式理解词性 



### 一丶名词、形容词、副词，这就是一切

语法核心是名词性成分，形容词性成分，副词性成分。他们构成简单句，简单句+连词构成复杂句。

### 二丶词性之间的修饰关系

词性种类包括以下，他们可以分成名词性成分，形容词性分成，副词性成分。名词、形容词【修饰名词】、副词【修饰动词、形容词、其他副词】。

备注
限定词: some any my your

以下案例

> 1. 名词属性成分
>    I love **you**.名词
>    I love **your hairstyle**.名词短语
>    I love **what he said**.名词性从句
>
> 2. 形容词属性成分
>    I need a **red** bag.形容词
>    I need a bag **that is red**，形容词从句
>    I need a friend **who is cool**.形容词从句
>
> 3. 副词属性的介词短语用于修饰动词、形容词、以及其他副词
>    修饰动词：
>    We went to a movie **after dinner**.
>    They have classes **at our local school**.
>    修饰形容词：
>    l am ready **for dinner**.
>    Sally is happy **with her new teacher**.
>    修饰其他副词：
>    We got there late **in the evening**.
>    Our team scored early **in the first quarter**.



### 二丶介词 = 形容词 or 副词

介词：不能单独使用，必须跟名词性成分配合使用，构成介词短语,介词短语用做**形容词或副词**。

以下案例

> The puma is **up** a tree，介词
> He looked **up**.副词
> Prices are **up**.形容词
> I need a bag **on the table**.介词短语用作形容词，形容词属性的介词短语一般用作后置定语，用来修饰名词。
> sally runs **like a bird**.介词短语用副词，副词属性的介词短语用于修饰动词、形容词、以及其他副词。
> We went to a movie **after dinner**.介词短语用作副词修饰动词。
> l am ready **for dinner**.介词短语用作副词修饰形容词。
> We got there late **in the evening**.介词短语用作副词修饰其他副词。



介词有以下

> 简单介词：as,at,by,during,with.…
> 分词介词：considering,including,given,granted.…
> 短语介词：ahead of,next to,because of，owning to,along with,as well as in case of,in charge of,in common with,as a result of in the absence of,to the best of,with an eye to...



## 第二章理解了简单句，你就理解了一切



### 一、主谓宾定状补

主(名词) 谓(动词) 宾(名词) 定(形容词) 状 (副词) 补(名词或者形容词)

简单句的五种基本句型

1. 主谓: She smiled.【不及物动词】。
2. 主谓宾: l love you.【及物动词】。
3. 主系表: That sounds good.【系动词】。
4. 主谓宾补: l painted the wall black.【及物动词】We callI him Mike.【及物动词】。
5. 主谓双宾: lLarry bought me a book.【及物动词】。



#### 1、补(名词或者形容词)：补充说明的额外成分

补语 = 宾语补语 or 主语补语【A is B】。
案例

> She painted the room **blue**.【room was blue】.
> We consider him **fool**.【he is a fool】.
> l found the **movie tobe very interesting**.【movie was interesting】.
> You should leave the door **open**.【door is open】.
> He is walking around **naked**【he was naked】.
> l asked him **to buy something for me**.【he was to buy something for me】.
>
> That's **how things work.**	
> I felt **betrayed.**
> He has become **used to the weather**.
> What matters is **whether Michael will come to the party**.
> I found this movie **to be really interesting**.
> HUAWEI Mate 60 Pro will go **global**！
> This woman**,small and thin**,has strong will.
> **Distressed and worried**,Xiaoming could barely stand the days prepping for his Kaoyan English,**completely panic-stricken,not able to see a glimpse of hope**.That changed when he met Larry,and just days into Larry's grammar crash course,he was so ready to crack all English exams**,no longer afraid and all smiles**.

备注
（1）naked修饰人的形容词，所以是主要补语，而不是副词形容walking around。
He is walking around **naked**
He is walking around **nakedly**

（2）补语是表语，简单句基本类型主系表: That sounds good.

### 二、简单句的构成

简单句的五种基本句型
1、主谓: She smiled.【不及物动词】
2、主谓宾: l love you.【及物动词】
3、主系表: That sounds good.【系动词】
4、主谓宾补: l painted the wall black.【及物动词】We callI him Mike.【及物动词】
5、主谓双宾: lLarry bought me a book.【及物动词】

备注
（1）主系表
系统词be是"="，其他系动词是"≈"。
表语是“主语补语”，名词或者形容词。

（2）主谓双宾
主谓双宾结构中，直接宾语通常是物品，间接宾语通常是人。
双宾语结构的句子，可以用介词for、to来改写：
l gave him a book. = I give a book to him.
Sally bought me a gift. = Sally bought a gift for me.

（3）主谓宾补
主谓宾补，补语是宾语补语。



## 第三章 从句比简单句更简单

### 一、从句 = 连词 + 简单句

1、并列结构的从句

简单句+简单句之间必须有连词。例如I love you,and you love me.
错误案例

> I love you  you love me.
> I love you, you love me.



2、主从结构的从句

主从结构，简单句和简单句之间构成从属关系。
案例

> **What** she said  surprised everyone. 【**What** she said 】主语从句，what是连词
> The important thing is **that** we tried our best.【we tried our best】宾语从句，that是连词



3，疑问词的词性

疑问词在从句中充当连词，同时也有词性。

> who(whom)	n
> whose	adj
> what	n,adj
> which	n,adj
> where	adv
> when	adv
> why	adv
> how	adv
> that	无/n



### 二、名词性从句

名词性从句包括主语从句，表语从句，宾语从句，同位语从句。总之用句子代替简单句中的名词短语。
案例



1、如何学好从句？

> 1. 把从句部分看作一个简单句。
> 2. 作为简单句的从句，要对应到简单句五种基本句型中的一种。
> 3. 从句的主谓宾定状补，都要清楚地找出来
> 4. 判断关系词（连词）在从句中担任何种成分，如果从句的主谓宾俱全，则关系词不可能担任主语、宾语等成分，只能充当副词性成分，反之，关系词则可能充当主语、宾语类型的名词性成分。
> 5. 判断关系词（连词）是否可能充当从句中修饰主语的形容词性成分（限定词成分）。
> 6. 按照简单句的陈述语序，重新理顺从句部分的语序
>



2、独立句子变成从句具体步骤

> 步骤一：调语序，存在倒装语序的，必须调整为陈述语序。
> 步骤二：加连词，从句必须有相应的连词来引导陈述句用that一般疑问句用whether，特殊疑问句用原本的疑问词作为连词。
> 步骤三：把连词置于从句的句首。
>
> 案例
> 【He is a transsexual】.doesn't matter.	陈述句
>  That he is transsexual doesn't matter.
>
> 【is he transsexual？】doesn't matter.	一般疑问句
>  Whether he is a transsexual doesn'tmatter.
>
> 【What is he？】doesnt matter.	特殊疑问句
>  What he is doesn't matter.
>
> 备注
> 疑问词作主语，则无需变更语序
> I don't know 【What happened yesterday？】
> I don't know   what happened yesterday.



#### 1、同位语从句

同位语 = 针对抽象名词的名词性解释说明。
同位语从句，名词性从句替代同位语。
案例

> Michael，myfriend.is a good guy.
> My favorite subject，**mathematics** ，requires logical thinking.
>
> The fact ，**that she lied**,disappointed everyone.

备注
补(名词或者形容词)：补充说明的额外成分。
同位语：针对抽象名词的名词性解释说明。



#### 2、形式主语 & 形式宾语

ENDWEIGHT，英语通常采用句末重心，头轻尾重。

案例

> **That Sally is beautiful** is true.	正确不常用
> It's true **that Sally is beautiful**.	常用，it做形式主语
>
> I find it unbelievable **that Sally is beautiful.**	常用，it做形式宾语
> I find **that Sally is beautiful** unreasonable. 	错误



#### 3、that省略

不影响理解情况下可以省略，宾语从句，表语从句可以省略

> ~~That~~ he is a transsexual doesn't matter.	错，主语从句
> I don't know ~~that~~ he is a transsexual.	对，宾语从句
> The problem is ~~that~~ he is a transsexual	对，表语从句



#### 4、whether和if能否互换的问题

能用whether不要用if
案例

> I am unsure about **whether** we should go to the party.
> I am unsure about **if** we should go to the party.?	介词后不能用if替换
> She couldn't decide **whether** to go to the movie or not.
> She couldn't decide **if** to go to the movie or not.	不定式前不能用if替换
> You must decide **whether** you want to study abroad or stay at home.
> You must decide **if** you want to study abroad or stay at home	歧义不能用if替换（if组成状语从句变成出国或在家修饰决定）



### 二、形容词性从句

形容词性从句是定语从句，表语从句，用来修饰先行词（被修饰的名词）。用句子代替简单句中的形容词。形容词性从句也遵循ENDWEIGHT。

1、学好形容词性从句的关键

> 掌握好简单句的五个基本句型，这是一切的基础
> 学习定语从句 ≠ 学习关系词，针对从句部分的语法分析才是重点。
> 深入理解“先行词”、“关系词”这两个概念。



2、形容词性从句的关系词

> 主语关系代词(名词)：who、which、that
> 宾语关系代词：(动词宾语)：who、whom、which、that
> 宾语关系代词：(介词宾语)：who、whom、which
> 状语关系副词：when、where、why
> 定语关系限定词：whose、which
> 补语关系代词：which、that



3、关系词的作用

作用一：重复指代先行词。
作用二：走起连词作用，连接两个有独立主谓结构的简单句
案例

> Sally is a teacher **who **is warm-hearted,hardworking,and quick in learning.



#### 1、主语关系代词

who(指代某人)、which(指代某人)、that(某人煤物)这三个关系代词都可以作定语从句的主语，

（1）用来指代人时，who比that常用；用来指代物时候，that比which常用，这是英美人使用关系代词的基本习惯。
案例

> He is reading a book **that** is about human history.
> Arich person is not one **Who** has the most,but is one **Who** needs the least.

（2）使用关系代词后，从句中原本被关系代词指代的部分（主语）必须删掉。
案例

> I like friends who ~~they~~  are passionate fans of Kobe Bryant.

（3）先行词的性质=关系词的性质，二者必须在单复数、主格宾格等等各个方面保持统一。
案例

> Music that ~~have~~ has great lyrics is my favorite.
> Michael loves friends who ~~is~~ are always help.



#### 2、宾语关系代词(动词宾语)

who(指代某人)、whom(指代某人)、which(指代某物)、that(某人某物)上述四个关系代词都可以作为形容词性从句中动词的宾语，也可以省略。
案例

> I want to have a firiend **who/whom/that/不填** I can fully trust.
> Michael likes every piece of music **that/which/不填** I recommend.
> This is the book **that/which/不填** I bought yesterday

（1）使用关系代词后，从句中原本被关系代词指代的部分（宾语）必须删掉。
案例

> I love the friends that I can fully trust ~~them~~.

（2）关系代词与从句谓语动词距离较远的时候，要注意分辨清楚句子的结构，一定要找到真正的谓
语动词，同时把从句作为一个简单句来分析，将其对应到简单句五种基本句型中的一种，尤其当
存在双宾语、宾语补语等结构时，要仔细分析这个“简单句”。
案例

> There exist certain traditions in Fujian that people accustomed to Northern ways
> of thinking find ~~them~~ weird.

（3）定语从句中大多数作为宾语的关系代词是可以省略的。如果定语从句的主语是比较长的名词短语，或者先行词与定语从句被其他成分隔开（距离较远））时，尽量不要省略关系代词。简而言之，不会引发岐义的，就可以省略，容易引发岐义的，则不省略。
案例

> I want to have a friend that I can fully trust.	正确 
> I want to have a friend I can fully trust.	正确
> There exist certain traditions in Fujian that people accustomed to Northern ways of thinking find weird.	正确
> There exist certain traditions in Fujian people accustomed to Northern ways of thinking find weird.	错误，Fujian people有歧义



#### 3、宾语关系代词(介词宾语)

who(指代某人)、whom(指代某人)、which(指代某物)、that(某人某物)上述四个关系代词都可以作为定语从句中介词的宾语（介词后的名词性成分），也可以省略。不过相比于作为动词宾语的关系代词来说，介词宾语的问题要更复杂，因为涉及到介词后置和介词前置的问题。

（1）定语从句中大多数作为宾语的关系代词是可以省略的

（2）句子容易造成岐义时，不要省略关系代词。

（3）作为介词宾语的关系代词，在介词后置的情况下，用法和动词宾语相同；介词前置的情况下，只能使用prep+whom（修饰人）以及prep十which（修饰物）的形式，而不能使用prep+that。短语动词中的介词，一般不前置。
案例

> The little girl **who** a lot of people are interested **in** is named Lucy.	正确，介词后置
> The little girl **whom** a lot of people are interested **in** is named Lucy.	正确，介词后置
> The little girl **that** a lot of people are interested **in** is named Lucy.	正确，介词后置
> The little girl a lot of people are interested **in** is named Lucy.	正确，介词后置可以省略
>
> The little girl **in who** a lot of people are interested is named Lucy.	错误，只能用prep whom
> The little girl **in whom** a lot of people are interested is named Lucy.	正确，只能用prep whom
> The little girl **in that** a lot of people are interested in is named Lucy.	错误，只能用prep whom
> The little girl **in** a lot of people are interested is named Lucy.	错误，只能用prep whom
>
> The conference room **in which** the meeting will take place is equipped with state-of-the-art technology.	正确，只能用prep which
>
> This is the very bag **for which** I've been looking.	错误，looking for介词短语



#### 4、状语关系副词

where(地点状语)、when(时间状语)、why(原因状语)上述关系代词都可以作为定语从句中状语。

（1）where地点状语，where = in which。
案例

> This is the town **in which** I grew up.
> This is the town **where** I grew up.

（2）when时间状语，when = on which。
案例

> I'll never forget the day **when ** l met you.
> I'll never forget the day **on which** I met you.
> I'll never forget the day that  met you.	正确，day不只有副词属性，还有名词属性，that可以做关系名词
> I'll never forget the day I met you.	正确，that可以省略

（2）why原因状语，why = for which。
案例

> That's the reason **why** Sally hates her friend Mary.
> That's the reason **for which** Sally hates her friend Mary



#### 5、定语关系限定词

whose(人或物限定词)、which(物限定词)上述关系代词都可以作为定语从句中限定词，限定词+名词使用组成所有格结构（he）。

（1）whose人或物限定词，whose = of which，whose表示所有格，组成+whose名词结构。
案例

> Michael lives in a house **of which** the roof is leaking	of which所有格，of which(house's) the roof
> Michael lives in a house **whose** roof is leaking.	whose所有格，whose(house's) the roof

（2）which不常用



#### 6、补语关系代词

that(指代某物）、which（指代某人)）上述关系代词都可以作为定语从句中补语关系代词。
案例

> Sally is a smart person,**which** I am not.	补语关系代词，i am not which（smart person）
> The nickname stupid-ass **that** those classmates named Michael doesn't
> sound friendly.	补语关系代词，those classmates named Michael that(stupid-ass)



#### 7、限制性&非限制性定语从句

非限定性定语从句有逗号，关系词只能用which（极少用that）、who（极少用that）、where、when。
区别

1. 非限制性定语从句的先行词可以是名词短语、或者整个主句，而限制性定语从句的先行词往往是单纯的名词短语。

1. 即便是相同的先行词（皆为名词短语），限制性、非限制性定语从句的意思也并不相同。限制性 = 筛选，非限制性 = 随便提一下。
2. 某些先行词，只能使用非限制性定语从句，而不能使用限制性定语从句。

案例

> The town,**which** is known for its street food,enjoys great fame.	非限制性，这座小镇名气很大，这里的小吃十分有名。
> The town **which** is known for its street food enjoys great fame.	限制性，这座以小吃而闻名的小镇十分有名。
>
> They said that I took the books,**which** was just not true.	非限制性先行词可以是名词短语。
>
> Beijing,**which** is capital of China,is a great city.	正确，非限制性
> Beijing **which** is capital of China,is a great city.	错误，限制性，专有名词Beijing是唯一的，不能使用限制性定语从句
>
> My grandmother **who** loves programming is 70 years old,	错误，限制性，普通名词也可能是专有名词，例如My grandmother



### 三、副词性从句

副词性从句（状语从句）的本质就是包含完整主谓结构的句子，作为副词性成分，对主句进行修饰，修饰的对象一般是主句的谓语动词、主句的表语形容词等。

#### 1、时间状语

when = 时间段 or 时间点，while = 时间段，as = 随着/正当/一边...一边，before = 之前，after = 之后，since = 自从，until = 主句持续性动词肯定式 or 主句短暂性动词否定式，as soon as、immediately 、the moment、minute、second = 一...就...
案例

> Sally telephoned me **while** I was doing my homework.	正确，doing（做作业）是时间段
> Sally telephoned me **when** I was doing my homework	正确
> I was walking on the road **when** suddenly someone stopped me.	正确
> I was walking on the road **while** suddenly someone stopped me.	错误，stopped（拦住）是时间点
>
> **As** China becomes richer,Chinese people spend more.	正确，随着becomes（中国发展）
> **While** China becomes richer, Chinese people spend more.x	错误，随着becomes（中国发展）是短暂性动词
>
> I handed in my homework **before** I was asked to	before之前
> I arrived **affer** he had left	after之后
> Sally and I haven't met each other **Since** I became a middle school student	since自从
>
> We had to stay here **until** it stopped raining	stay持续性动词，主句是肯定句式We had to stay here
> We didn't go out **until** it stopped raining	go out短暂性动词，主句是否定句We didn't go out
>
> **Until** it stopped raining,we didn't go out.	副词性从句前置
> Not **until** it stopped raining did we go out.	not提前的倒装句not do
> It was not **until** it stopped raining that we went out. 	强调句或者是强调句not do
>
> It began to rain **as soon as** we arrived home.	as soon as一...就...
> It began to rain **immediately** we arrived home.	immediately一...就...
> It began to rain **the moment/minute/second** we arrived home.	the moment/minute/second一...就...
>
> **No sooner** had we arrived home **than** it began to rain.	倒装句Not do
> **Hardly** had we arrived home **when** it began to rain.	倒装句
> **Scarcely** had we arrived home **When** it began to rain.	倒装句



#### 2、地点状语

where = 地点
案例

> I plant trees **where** there is a lot of sunshine.



#### 3、原因状语

because、for、as = 因为，since = 既然
案例

> We didn't go to the party **because** it was raining
> We didn't go to the party,**for** it was raining
> **Since** you're a middle school student,you should know how to study.
> **As** you're a middle school student,you should know how to study.

备注
because否定转移，根据语意判断
案例

> I didn't marry her because she was beautiful	错误，我没和她结婚，因为她太漂亮了。正确，我并不是因为她漂亮才和结婚的。
> Sally doesn't play the piano because she likes to Saly	错误，不弹钢琴，因为她喜欢。正确，Sally并不是因为喜欢才去弹钢琴的。



#### 4、目的状语

so that 、in order that = 为了 ,so that可以省略
案例

> I spoke slowly **so that** the students could understand me better.
> I spoke slowly **in order that** the students could understand me better.
> Sally opened the window **(so) that** she could breathe some fresh air.
> Sally opened the window **so (that)** she could breathe some fresh air.


（1）if 和 in case的区别
案例

> Take an umbrella **if** it rains.	要是下雨了，就带把伞。（还没带呢，因为还没下雨。）
> Take an umbrella **in case** it rains	带把伞，免得下雨。（伞已带。）

（2）结果状语从句&目的状语从句
案例

> I spoke slowly so that the students could understand me better.	could understand能够理解，目的状语从句
> I spoke slowly so that the students understood me better.	understood 理解，结果状语从句



#### 5、结果状语

so...that... 、such...that... = 太xx以至于xx，区别在于so副词修饰形容词、其他副词，such形容词修饰名词。结果状语从句修饰主句。
案例

> Sally is **so** smart **that** she always tops our school	so 修饰形容词smart，结果状语从句**that** she always tops our school修饰主句Sally is **so** smart
> Sally is **such** a smart girl **that** she always tops our school	such修饰名词a smar girl that
> Sally is **such that **she always tops our school	sunch根据语境省略a smar girl
>
> Sally runs **so** fast **that** nobody can beat her in the 100m sprint	so 修饰副词fast



#### 6、条件状语

if、in case= 如果，unless = 除非，in case、once、as、so long as、so far as = 只要
案例

> **If** you work hard,you will succeed.
> **Unless** you work hard,you won't succeed.
> **If** you don't work hard,you won't succeed.
> Please let me know **in case** you need anything
> **Once** you have learned English,you will find it interesting.
> You may leave **as/so long as you** come back on time.
> **So far as** the weather remains okay,we shall start tomorrow.



#### 7、让步状语

though、although、enen if、 while 、no matter、however = 虽然、尽管、即使。as引导倒装让步状语从句Not do

案例

> **Though/although** he tried hard,(yet/stil)he failed.	
> He failed **even if** he tried hard.
> **While** he tried,he (still)failed.
> **No matter** how hard-working he was,he (still)failed.
> **However** hard-working he was,he (still)failed.
>
> Difficult **as** it is to believe,there are fish that can live without water.
> Much **as** I respect him,I can't agree with him.
> Wounded **as** he was,he finished the basketball game.
> Fail **as** he did,he would never give up.

备注
despite、In spite（尽管）不是让步状语
案例

> Despite his hard work,he (still)failed.
> Despite that he tired hard,he (still)failed.
> In spite of his hard work,he (still)failed.



#### 8、比较状语从句

案例 not do

> This work is not as difficult as you think.	这项工作没有你想象的那么难。
> Sally is as hard-working as I/me.	Sally 和我一样勤奋
> Sally runs as fast as I/me.	Sally跑得和我一样快。
> Sally is as beautiful as smart.Sally is as beautiful as she is smart.	Sally 既美丽又聪明
> Michael learns as quickly as (he does)efficiently.	Michael学起东西来既快速又高效。
> Sally is no more hard-working than her sister.	Sally并不比她姐姐更勤奋。
> Sally is no less hard-working than her sister.	Sally和她姐姐一样勤奋。
> Nothing is more valuable than time.	时光无价。
> Reading is to the mind what/as exercise is to the body.	句型A is to B what C is to D，阅读之于思维就如同锻炼之于身体。
> Reading does for the mind what exercise does for the body.	阅读之于思维就如同锻炼之于身体。



## 第四章 非谓语动词

### 一、什么是非谓语动词

1、一个句子里，只能有一个谓语动词。（因为非谓语动词已经不是动词了）
2、非谓语动词 = 名词成分 or 形容词成分 or 副词成分
3、虽然当作名词、形容词、副词来用，但具备动词特征，如时态变化，可以携带自己宾语、状语等

| 非谓语动词 | 是动词吗？ | 是谓语动词吗？ | 什么词性         | 于普通的名词、形容词副词的区别                               |
| :--------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 不定式     | ×          | ×              | 名词/形容词/副词 | 保留了动词的特点，可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语、状语 |
| 动名词     | ×          | ×              | 名词             | 保留了动词的特点，可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语、状语 |
| 分词       | ×          | ×              | 形容词/副词      | 保留了动词的特点，可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语、状语 |

备注
不定式和动名词和分词的区别

1. 不定式：强调具体的、一次性的、待实现的动作，一般与某个特殊的动作执行者联系在一
   起
   动名词：一般性事实，意义上更加抽象，一般不与特定的动作执行者联系在一起。

2. 动名词通常表示动作或状态的概念，常用于做名词
   分词根据上下文可以表示主动、被动、完成、进行等不同的概念，常用于形容词或者副词。





### 二、不定式

不定式：（不一定是什么词性的一个东西），不定式具备名词属性、形容词属性、副词属性。不定式可在句子中作主语、宾语、定语、状语、补语（表语）、插入语、同位语。
案例

> It is foolish **to lie**.	主语
> I will try **to forget you**.	宾语
> The question **to be discussed** is important.	定语
> We eat **to live**.	状语
> our plan is **to finish the work in two weeks**.	表语/主语补语
> He asked me **to smile**.	宾语补语
>
> **To be frank**,I hate parties	副词做插入语
> ls this your purpose,**to avoid being punished**?	同位语



#### 1、名词属性不定式作主语、表语、宾语

案例

> **To make you understand** me is impossible.	作主语
> It is impossible **to make you understand me**.	作主语，it形式主语
>
> To know everything is **to know nothing**.	作表语
> He was seen **to enter the laboratory**.	作表语，to enter the laboratory组成名词，he is to enter the laboratory主语补语
>
> I will try **to forget you**.	作宾语
> He decded **to return after receiving a letter from Michael	**作宾语
> He forgot **which way to take**.	作宾语



（1）句末重心原则：形式宾语 or 宾语前置
案例

> She found **to leave here** impossible.	错误
> She found **it** impossible to leave here.	正确，it做形式宾语
> I took **to have been invited to the meeting** as an honor.	错误
> l took **it** as an honor to have been invited to the meeting.	正确，it做形式宾语



#### 2、名词属性不定式作宾语补语、同位语

案例

> He asked me **to smile**.	宾语补语
> He asked me **to finish my job before noon**.	宾语补语
> ls this your purpose,**to avoid being punished**?	同位语



（1）使役动词、感官动词后续的不定式需省略to，因为to do表示想去做，使役动词或感官动词表示一定要去做
案例

> He made me **stay for the night**.
> She watched Michael **enter the room**.



#### 3、形容词属性不定式作后置定语

案例

> The letter **from Michael** shocked everyone.
> We expressed our desire **to join their team**.

（1）句末重心原则

> At the meeting a decision **to transfer a part of the students to another school** was made.?
> At the meeting a decision was made **to transfer a part of the students to another school.**



#### 4、副词属性不定式作状语

案例

> **To improve my English**,I went to America.	目的状语
> He went abroad **never to return**.	结果状语
> She wept **to hear the news**.	原因状语
> **To hear him sing**,you might take him for a girl.	条件状语
> The old man walked slowly,hunched over,**as if to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders**.	方式状语
> **To do his best**,he could not fulfil his task in time.	让步状语



#### 5、副词属性做插入语

插入语指的是在句子中用来表达情感、感叹、呼喊或引起注意的词语或短语
To be frank,I hate parties,To be fair,he has worked hard these days,to begin with,to be fair,to be frank,to conclude,to be honest,
案例

> **To be frank**,I hate parties
> T0 be fair,he has worked hard these days.



#### 6、不定式作逻辑主语，逻辑宾语

（1）不定式中的动词必须有明确的逻辑主语，默认指向句子的主语，如需指向其他对象，可使用介词for、of、wth带出不定式单独的逻辑主语。

（2）不定式中的动词如果是及物动词，则必须有逻辑宾语，默认指向句子的名词性成分（主语、宾语、补语)如果找不到合适的逻辑宾语，则会发生语法错误。

（3）逻辑主语、逻辑宾语并不是不定式特有的要求，所有的非谓语动词都有这种要求。
案例

> Sally will be proud to win the competition.	逻辑主语Saly，Saly将会为赢得比赛而感到骄傲。
> Sally will be proud for her Sister to win the competitionSaly	逻辑主语for her Sister， Saly将会为她的妹妹赢得比赛而感到骄傲。
> It's very wise not to argue with the teacher.	逻辑主语省略us，我们不跟老师争论，这很明智。
> It's very wise [of us]not to argue with the teacher.	逻辑主语us，我们不跟老师争论，这很明智。
> It's very wise of Michael not to argue with the teacher.	逻辑主语Michael，Michael不跟老师争论，这很明智。
>
> I need a pen to write.write a pen 	逻辑宾语错误
> I need a pen to write with.	逻辑宾语正确，write with a pen 
> I need a bed to sleep.	逻辑宾语 错误
> I need a bed to sleep in.	逻辑宾语正确，sleep in a bed v
> Michael is the best person to consult about the matter.	逻辑宾语错误
> Michael is the best person to consult about the matter with.	逻辑宾语正确，consult about the matter with Michael



#### 7、不定式的时态

（1）什么是不定式的时态

1. 现在时态(todo)：不定式动作在谓语动词动作的同时或之后。

2. 完成时态（(to have done):不定式动作在谓语动词动作之前。

3. 进行时态(to be doing)：在谓语动词动作发生时，不定式动作正在进行。

4. 被动式(to be done)：不定式的逻辑主语是不定式动作的对象或承受者。
   案例

   > He wants **to take** some photos.	一般时态，他想拍几张照片
   > He wants Sally **to take** some photos.	一般时态，他想让Sally拍几张照片。
   > He wants some photos to be taken.	被动，他想找人拍几张照片，照片被拍，指定by somebody让某人拍，不指定就是“找人”拍

|              | 主动                 | 被动                 |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 一般时态     | to write             | to be written        |
| 进行时态     | to be writing        | 无                   |
| 完成时态     | to have written      | to have been written |
| 完成进行时态 | to have been writing | 无                   |

案例

> Scientists try **to apply** this new theory into practice.	一般时态，不定式动作与谓语动词动作同时发生
> I hope **to visit** Beijing someday.	一般时态，不定式动作在谓语动词动作之后
> I'm sorry **to have troubled** you so much.	完成时态，不定式动作在谓语动词动作之前
> The energy of coal is found **to have come** from the sun.	完成时态，不定式动作在谓语动词动作之前
> I'd like **to have seen** the film.	完成时态，不定式动作在谓语动词动作之前
> They were said **to be making** a new experiment.	完成时态，不定式动作与谓语动词动作同步发生
> The problem remains **to be further discussed**.	完成时态，不定式动作的逻辑主语(problem)是不定式动作(discuss)的承受者。
> It is an honor for me **to have been invited** to the meeting.	被动+完成式,to have been invited被邀请



### 三、动名词

动名词的构成是V+ing，语法层面上动名词 = 名词，但是保留了动词的一些特征，可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语、状语。动名词可在句子中作主语、宾语、定语、补语（表语）。
案例

> **Learning** is easy.	主语
> Larry suggests **playing basketball**.	宾语
> She insisted on **paying for it**.	介词宾语
> a flying jacket[动名词] = a jacket for flying=飞行夹克（飞行员穿的夹克）	定语
>
> Talking to him is **talking to a wall.**	表语



#### 1、动名词作主语

案例

> **Learning** is easy.
> **Learning English** is easy.
> **Talking** is nice.
> **Talking to him** is nice.
> **Walking** is my only exercise.
> **Walking around the school** is my only exercise.
> **Smoking** is bad.
> **Always smoking in public** is bad.
> **Using a language** is not easy.(It's not easy using a language)
> **Really using a language in the real country where it is spoken** is not easy.



（1）句末重心原则
案例

> **Talking to him** is nice.
> **It**'s nice **talking to him**.
> **Using a language** is not easy.
> It's not easy **using a language**.



（2）动名词作主语的特殊句型

句型1：it is no good/use/a waste of time    doing sth = 干某事没用
案例

> It's no use talking to him.
> It's not much use buying a car.
> It's a waste of time trying to explain.
> Is it any good trying to explain?

句型2：There is no point/use/good(in)   doing sth.=干某事没必要、没意义
案例

> There is no use arguing with him.
> There is no point in doing that.

句型3：There is no doing sth = 不可能做到某事 
案例

> There is no telling what will happen tomorrow.
> There's no knowing the future.



#### 2、动名词作宾语

（1）词意和不定式to do（将要做）冲突的动词，宾语用动名词。
案例

> Larry suggests **playing basketball**.
> Sally admitted **taking the money**.
> You should avoid **eating too much**.
> l like **traveling very much**.
> l hate **lying and cheating**

备注
动词包括
admit,advise,avoid,consider,deny,like,dislike,enjoy,feel like,finish,forgive, give up,can't help,imagine,involve,mention,mind,miss,permit,prohibit,resist,risk suggest......

（2）介词宾语
案例

> She insisted on **paying for it**.	
> Sally couldn't keep from **laughing**.
> Michael thought of **writing to me**.
> Have you ever dreamed of **becoming a astronaut**?
> I don't feel like **going out today.**
> I look forward to **leaving this town and starting a new life.**
> **From** having parties **to** chatting online,I just love knowing new people.



（3）特殊句型

特殊句型1：Have difficulty/trouble/problems/a hard time./.(in)doing sth = 做某事遇到了困难
案例

> I once had a hard time **getting used to living in Beijing**.

特殊句型2：can't help/resist doing,can't keep from doing...... =情不自禁做某事
案例

> I can't help **reading this book**.It's so much fun.
> No one can help **liking Tom**;he is such a cute boy.



#### 3、动名词作表语

案例

> Talking to him is **talking to a wall.**
> Sally's hobby is **painting**.
> Their pastime is **going to movies.**
> Her favorite sport is **skiing**.
> Michael's job is **taking care of the sheep on the farm.**
> Seeing is **believing**.



#### 4、动名词作定语

（1）判断是动名词还是分词
动名词是名词，分词是形容词性的
案例

> a flying jacket[动名词] = a jacket for flying=飞行夹克（飞行员穿的夹克）
> a flying jacket[分词] = a jacket that is flying=飞行的夹克（会飞的夹克）？[jacket和flying构成主谓关系]



#### 5、动名词的逻辑主语问题

动名词的动词必须有明确的逻辑主语，默认指向句子的主语。如需指向其他对象，主语用所有格，宾语所有格或者普通格，不定代词用普通格，逻辑主语太长用普通格。
案例

> Her/Sally's)going off in such a harry is strange	(主语：所有格)
> I'm not happy about Sally(Sally's)going off in such a hurry.	宾语：二者皆可
> I'm not happy about someone going off in such a hurry.	不定代词：普通格
>
> I've always had a dream of my father,mother,and living together.	逻辑主语太长：使用普通格



#### 6、动名词的语态、语气问题

（1）现代英语中，动词deserve,need,require,want,won't bears等之后的动名词，其主动语态表示
被动意义，动名词与句子主语在逻辑上是动宾关系；形容词worth,介词past,beyond,后面的动名
词，与上述逻辑类似。
案例

> The garden needs watering.	花园需要被浇水了
> He deserved praising.	他值得被表扬。
> You hair wants cutting.	你的头发该被剪了。
>
> This book is worth reading	这本书值得被读
> The bad style requires getting rid of.	坏的风格需要被去掉。



#### 7、动名词和不定式的区别

（1）不定式和动名词含义不同
不定式：强调具体的、一次性的、待实现的动作，一般与某个特殊的动作执行者联系在一
起
动名词：一般性事实，意义上更加抽象，一般不与特定的动作执行者联系在一起。
案例

> He hates drinking.[讨厌所有人喝酒]
> He hates to drink.[讨厌自己（下一次）喝酒的动作]



（2）有些动词后只能接动名词，如词意和不定式to do（将要做）冲突的动词。
有些动词后只能不定式，如afford，choose，词意都是必然后后续动作的。
案例

> She decided to **avoid eating** sugary foods
> Michael **admit stealing** the money.
>
> We can't **afford to buy** such an expensive house.
> They **chose to pay** a visit to America.

（3）动名词和不定式词义区别
案例

> Sally stopped crying.	sally停止了哭泣
> Sally stopped to cry.	sally停下来去哭泣
> Remember to mail this letter tomorrow.	记住明天把这封信寄出去
> I don't remember mailing the letter.	我不记得寄过这个信
> l cannot help to repair the car.	我不能帮忙修理汽车。
> l cannot help laughing.	我忍不住笑了。



### 四、分词

语法层面上形容词性成分 or 副词性成分，即定语 or 状语 or 补足语。但是保留了动词的一些特征，可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语、状语。分词可在句子中作定语、状语、补语（表语，补足语）。
案例

> 现在分词
> a flying jacket[分词] = a jacket that is flying=飞行的夹克（会飞的夹克）？[jacket和flying构成主谓关系，兼正在进行]	定语
> Weather **permitting**, we'll go fishing tomorrow.	状语
> This is **humiliating**.	表语
> I heard Sally **singing** .	补足语
>
> 过去分词
> **published** writings	定语，及物动词被动，被出版的著作
> **faded** roses	定语，不及物动词表完成，已经褪色的玫瑰
> **Given more time**,we could have done better.	状语.
> Things are always **complicated**.	表语



#### 1、分词的意义

（1）现在分词

表示主动的、一般的动作，兼有正在进行的动作
案例

> a puzzling problem = a problem that puzzles people 	一个让人困惑的问题
> an understanding man = a man who understands people 	一个通情达理的人
>
> The girl **standing at the door** is my classmate Sally	正在进行的动作
> The little girl **smiling at me** is really lovable.	正在进行的动作



（2）过去分词

及物动词表示被动的、一般的动作，兼有完成的动作。
案例

> a broken cup = a cup that has been broken
> a respected writer = a writer who is respected
> a trained dog = a dog that has been trained

不及物动词表示主动的、一般的动作，兼有完成的动作。
案例

> a sunken ship = a ship that has sunken
> fallen leaves = leaves that have fallen
> a married man = a man who has married
> returned students = students who have returned



#### 2、分词作状语

（1）避免悬垂分词问题（不指定逻辑主语，默认逻辑主语错误）

【名词+分词】结构
案例

> **Nobody** having anymore to say,the meeting was closed.	指定Nobody，否则逻辑主语就是the meeting having anymore
> **All the money** spent,we started looking for work.	
> **Weather** permitting,we'll go fishing tomorrow.

【with+名词+分词】结构
案例

> The old man often takes a walk after dinner **with his dog** following him.
> A car drove by,**with smoke** pouring from its behind.

备注
固定结构不考虑悬垂分词
案例

> **Generally speaking**,men are stronger than women.
> **Strictly speaking**,girls are smarter than boys.
> **Judging from what he has done**,he is a lazy student.
> **Talking of English**,she is the best student.
> **Considering she has no experience**,she has done a good job.
> **Granting that he has made a mistake**,he is not to blame.

（2）分词作条件状语
案例

> Given more time,we could have done better.
> If we had been given more time,we could have done better.
> Weather permitting,we'll go fishing tomorrow.
> If weather permits,we'll go fishing tomorrow.

（3）分词作时间状语
案例

> Once installed,this machine operates automatically.
> Once it is installed,this machine operates automatically.
> Locking the door,he went home.
> After he locked the door,he went home.
> Hearing the joke,he started laughing.
> After he heard the joke,he started laughing.

（4）分词作原因状语
案例

> Being busy,he will not come today.
> Because he is busy,he will not come today.
> Not knowing what to do next,I need your advice.
> Because I don't know what to do,I need your advice.

（5）分词作让步状语
案例

> Having been abroad for years,he still can't speak English.
> Though he has been abroad for ten years,he still can't speak English.
> Although understanding no Chinese,he was able to communicate.
> Although he understood no Chinese,he was able to communicate.

（6）分词作结果状语
案例

> Her husband died,leaving her with two children.
> Her husband died,(so)that he left her with two brothers.
> He fired,killing an enemy.
> He fired,so (that)he killed an enemy.

（7）分词作方式状语
案例

> He earns a living driving a car.
> He earns a living as he drives a car.
> Sally came running hurriedly.
> Sally came as if she was running hurriedly.

（8）分词作状语时，可保留连词
状语从句转换成分词时，保留连词
案例

> When waiting for the bus,I saw a little cat walk to me.
> When I was waiting for the bus,I saw a little cat walk to me.
> A/though living in America,Sally knows a lot about China.
> A/though she lives in America,Sally knows a lot about China.
> If seen from far away,the sheep looks like a dog.
> If it is seen from far away,the sheep looks like a dog.
> After having done her homework,Sally went home.
> After she did her homework,Sally went home.



#### 3、分词作表语

（1）作为表语的形容词必然跟在系动词之后；
（2）作为表语的分词，很大程度上已经形容词化了，可以被副词修饰，也可以有比较级。

现在分词
案例

> This is humiliating.
> What he says sounds more convincing.

过去分词
案例

> Things are always complicated.
> She is deeply read in literature.



#### 4、分词作定语

（1）现在分词作定语

现在分词做定语时，表示其所修饰的名词是分词动作的发出者，二者构成主谓关系
且兼有正在进行的含义。
单个现在分词做定语，一般放在所修饰的名词之前；如放在所修饰的名词之后，则视为一种强调。
案例

> singing birds	分词动作的发出者，二者构成主谓关系且兼有正在进行的含义。
>
> on the following day->on the day following	强调following接下来

（2）过去分词作定语

及物动词的过去分词做定语时，其所修饰的名词是分词行为的承受者，构成动宾关系，表示被动行为。
不及物动词的过去分词做定语时，其不表示被动意义，仅仅表示完成。
一般放在所修饰的名词之前；如放在所修饰的名词之后，则视为一种强调。
案例

> published writings	出版的著作
> a charmed girl	迷人的女孩
>
> faded roses	褪色的玫瑰
> a sunken boat沉船
>
> A penny saved is a penny **gained**.	省一分钱等于赚一分钱。强调gained赚

（3）句末重心原则
单个分词做定语，一般前置；分词短语做定语，一般后置。
案例

> The **arriving** train is from Beijing.
> The train **arriving by eight** is from Beijing.
> The **stolen** car was found abandoned in a nearby alley.
> The car **stolen from the factory** was found abandoned in a nearby alley.

#### 5、分词作补足语

分词作补足语（宾语补语）一般后置，一般仅限于感官动词之后，如see，hear，smell，watch
案例

> I heard Sally **singing .**	singing做补足语
> I heard Sally,and Sally was singing.	正确，singing 做补语
> I heard a singing Sally.(I heard a sally who was singing.)	错误，singing 做定语是错误，句意是我听到一个sally在唱歌

（1）不定式与分词的区别

不定时作补语：、强调一般性动作，或者自始至终的全过程
分词作补语：强调正在进行
案例

> I saw Michael climb up the tree.	我看到Michael爬到了树顶。
> I saw Michael climbing up the tree.	我看到Michael正在爬树。

#### 6、使用分词的注意事项

（1）一般式和完成式的区别
案例

> Having sung a song,he sat down.	唱完了一首歌，他坐了下来。
> Singing a song,he sat down.	他一边唱着歌一边坐了下来。
>
> Having eaten the hamburger,he went ou	吃掉那个汉堡，他出了门：
> Eating the hamburger,he went out.	他一边吃着汉堡一边出了门。

（2）动词的用法问题

明确动词是及物动词含义，不及物动词含义。
案例

> Chinese children grown in the US speak good English.	错误，grow的过去分词用作“种植”
> Chinese children raised in the US speak good English.	正确
> Chinese children who grow up in the US speak good English.	正确



### 五、非谓语动词和从句的相互转换

#### 1、名词性从句->名词、动名词、不定式

案例

> I don't know that he is a transsexual
> I don't know his being a transsexual.
> Whether he is a transsexual [or not]doesn't matter.
> His being a transsexual or not doesn't matter.
> The problem is what he is.
> The problem is his identity.
> What you decide will greatly impact our future.
> Your decision will greatly impact our future.
> His dream is that he becomes a successful entrepreneur.
> His dream is to become a successful entrepreneur.

#### 2、形容词性从句->形容词、不定式、介词短语、分词

案例

> We need an teacher who is warm-hearted,hardworking,and quick in learning.
> We need an warm-hearted,hard-working,and fast-learning teacher.(少见)
> Michael likes friends who are always ready to help
> Michael likes ready-to-help friends.
> I like the flowers that are on the table
> I like the flowers on the table
> In Fujian there exist certain traditions that people accustomed to Northern ways of thinking find strange
> In Fujian there exist certain traditions not to be easily understood by people accustomed to Northern ways f thinking

#### 3、副词从句->不定式、介词短语、分词

案例

> 时间
> When I opened the window,the cat jumped out.
> With my opening the window,the cat jumped out.
> 地点
> People plant trees where there are a lot of sunshine.
> People plant trees in sunlit places
> 结果
> l opened the window so that the cat jumped out.
> l opened the window,the cat jumping out.
> 目的
> l opened the window so that the cat could jump out
> l opened the window,the cat being able to jump out
> 条件
> If you heat water,you can change it into steam.
